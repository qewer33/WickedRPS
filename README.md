Play it over at: https://rps.qewer.dev

WickedRPS is a simple game based off the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game but with a twist. Instead of playing a one to one duel, you set up a battlefield and the game plays itself! The tiles move around randomly and the game rules apply (Rocks eat Scissors, Scissors eat Papers and Papers eat Rocks).

This idea is not original and was shamelessly stolen from [Peter Ganunis' "Living RPS"](http://peterganunis.com/rpsite.html) I really liked the idea so I decided to make a clone of it myself.

If you like this game and like what I do over at [my website](https://qewer.dev), consider supporting me on Ko-fi!
